Hey there! ✦✦

I’m Rei, an aspiring systems engineering graduate based in Venezuela. 🇻🇪

I'm a product designer who excels at turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless. ⚡︎

- I'm currently working on my graduate project which takes a lot of my energy as I keep getting ideas to get further with my objectives!
- I'm tryna become a data engineer who uses AI for web solutions.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me studying fashion to upcycle my own clothes, training calisthenics, practicing a language... I also enjoy learning about psychology, specially about BPD. ☘︎
