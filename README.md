Hi there! 
Iâ€™m Rei, an aspiring systems engineering graduate based in Venezuela. ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª

I'm a product designer who excels at turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

- I'm currently working on my graduate project which takes a lot of my energy as I keep getting ideas to get further with my objectives!
- I'm trying to become a data engineer who uses AI.

Outside of code and Figma, youâ€™ll find me studying fashion to upcycle my own clothes, training calisthenics, practicing a language... I also enjoy learning about psychology, specially about BPD. :)

Fun Facts:
- I ADORE drinking bitter coffee and eating sour gummies.
- The Weeknd, Joji, The Neighbourhood and Daft Punk are my most inspirational artists.
